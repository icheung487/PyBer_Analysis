# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
I was just hired as a data analyst at Pyber, ride-sharing app. company.  My first project is to perform an exploratory analysis on their data,finding the relationships between cities, drivers and fares. After performing different visual charts between the three main categories, I was given another new project.  The new project entails providing a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type.

* As you can see in the above chart, about 81% of the drivers worked in the urban area, while only 3% worked in rural areas. This is due to the demand from the above chart of the number of rides in the urban area.  This shows a correlation between the number of rides, drives and fares(see below pie chart) for each city type. As the the number of rides grow so does the drives and fare as well.
