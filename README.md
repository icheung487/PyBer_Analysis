# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
I was just hired as a data analyst at Pyber, ride-sharing app. company.  My first project is to perform an exploratory analysis on their data,finding the relationships between cities, drivers and fares. After performing different visual charts between the three main categories, I was given another new project.  The new project entails providing a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type.
