# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
I was just hired as a data analyst at Pyber, ride-sharing app. company.  My first project is to perform an exploratory analysis on their data,finding the relationships between cities, drivers and fares. After performing different visual charts between the three main categories, I was given another new project.  The new project entails providing a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
### Overview of the Pyber Summary:

* The figure above shows how rides in urban cities contributed about 68% from Jan-May in 2019. It's clear that during this time most of Pyber's overall rides came from urban cities, then suburban, and rural citities.  Rural cities only made up of about 5% of the overall which is very low when comparing to urban cities.

* As you can see in the above chart, about 81% of the drivers worked in the urban area, while only 3% worked in rural areas. This is due to the demand from the above chart of the number of rides in the urban area.  This shows a correlation between the number of rides, drives and fares(see below pie chart) for each city type. As the the number of rides grow so does the drives and fare as well.

* When looking at the average fare per ride, customers pay about $10 higher in the rural aread vs. urban. Customers in the rural areas pay about $35 per ride, while the urban customers pay about $25 per ride. 
* As a driver, it's an attractive market for them in the rural areas since they average about $55 per fare. While drivers in the urban areas make not be so happy since they average about $39 less than rural drivers and $23 less than suburban drives.

* The above multiple-line chart, "Total Fare by City Type," provides an overall trend of total fare in rural, suburban and urban cities from Jan to April in 2019.  This is a snapshot of the fare happening in Q1 2019. In the yellow line, which represents urban cities, there was a growing trend from Jan. to end of Feb. This trend seems to be similiar to suburban cities as well when looking at the red line.  In the blue line, which represents the rural cities, there's a slight growth from Jan to Feb but you can see it starts to decline after April.  It's interesting to see that there's a similar trend between all cities when looking at overall. 



## Summary: 
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
* Drivers are earning more in rural cities than urban cities, which leads to potential risk for drivers wanting to leave the urban market and focus on the rural cities instead.  I would recommend CEO to increase the fare for drivers in the urban cities since there's a need of these drivers to continue the demand. 
* It's clear most of the revenue comes from urban cities so we need to find ways to encourage more people to ride-share in the other areas: rural or suburban.  I would recommend to further analyze why there's low demand in the rural or suburban areas.  It could be a possible that customers don't know about ride-share.
* I would recommended a employee incentive plan for suburban drivers since this is the second best performing city for Pyber.  This is opportunity to expand this market since there's about 625 rides and only about 490 drivers with a strong revenue trend when looking at the line chart.
